The Contact website, launched in September 2014, is an example of a major website transformation, demonstrating deep definition and design phases, an intensive UX/UI process and targeting a broad spectrum of residential, business consumer and corporate audiences.

Designworks had been engaged for three years to undertake a major transformation programme for Contact, elevating it from an electricity retailer in a commodity market, to a preferred, relevant brand, with activities re-centered around the customer.

As part of a significant innovation programme addressing every aspect of its customer engagement, both acquisition and retention, Designworks had been heavily involved in a digital solutions platform, to ensure an 'always on' customer relationship, while lowering the cost to serve.

As a pivotal aspect of its on-line strategy, we've set out to create a joyful, out of category, on-line experience for Contact's consumers. Contact aims to be a valued part of Kiwis' lives, by truly understanding the way they live , so our goal was to make the website experience as useful, easy to understand and delightful as possible.

The site also needed to work alongside a major systems upgrade and ensure all aspects of the site IA, UX and sign up process would be seamlessly applied with underlying integration with form re-design and scope for further site development.

We started with an extensive stakeholder and needs state analysis. We utilised a wide range of tools to identify pain points in the previous sign-up process and importantly, where potential customer attrition was taking place and to innovate around those 'moments of truth'.

The site design is a strong example of Contact's brand purpose 'Comfy Logic' and combined with a powerful CMS in Sitecore, is becoming a key interface in translating a transformed brand positioning, with a digital experience already providing Contact with confidence in pushing its retail strategy on-line as part of a wider ecosystem of digital tools.

My role in this project was as Creative Director, working with our Digital Strategist and design and development
